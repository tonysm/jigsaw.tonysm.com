            <p>I'm working at <a href="https://worksitesafety.ca/">Worksite Safety</a> as a Lead PHP Developer. Working primarily with Laravel/PHP/Vue.</p>
            <p>Before that, I worked at <a href="https://madewithlove.com/">madewithlove</a> as a Full-Stack Software Engineer, and part-time DevOps for a bit more than 5 years. Built the most different kind of projects: from content platforms, to booking websites, to real-estate systems, and even a bit of IoT working on a building management platform (yes, automating all sorts of things in a building).</p>
            <p>As part-time DevOps person, I many deploying and configuring local development environments on a lot of different projects. We had a lot different projects there, so I had to learn a bunch of different OPS tools and platforms, such as Docker, Kubernetes, Laravel Forge, Laravel Envoyer, DigitalOcean, AWS (including, but not limited to, some non-conventional services like the AWS Transcribe and AWS IoT Core), Azure, GCP, among other things.</p>
            <p>And before that, I worked as a Back-end Engineer at Gabstr, a location-based social network. Built the APIs we used and a geo-location based content platform on top of Redis and PostGIS.</p>

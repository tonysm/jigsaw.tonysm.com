                <p>I work at <a href="https://tighten.co/">Tighten</a> as a Programmer (Full Stack).</p>
                <p>I recently worked at <a href="https://worksitesafety.ca/">Worksite Safety</a> as a Lead PHP Developer, primarily with Laravel/PHP/Vue. I led a team of 3 other devs. We applied <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/webbook">Shape Up</a>, so worked on the pitches, planned the Cycles, and even executed them, having 1-on-1s with the team, things like that. I also did an infrastructure migration, we moved a huge WordPress site from a single DO droplet to AWS using read/write replicas, S3, etc.</p>
                <p>And before that, I worked at <a href="https://madewithlove.com/">madewithlove</a> as a Full-Stack
                    Software Engineer, and part-time DevOps for a bit more than 5 years. Built the most different kind
                    of projects: from content platforms, to booking websites, to real-estate systems, and even a bit of
                    IoT working on a building management platform (yes, automating all sorts of things in a building).
                </p>
                <p>As part-time DevOps person, I managed to deploy and configure local development environments on a lot
                    of different stacks. I was part of a bunch of different projects, so I interacted with a set of different
                    OPS tools and platforms, such as Docker, Kubernetes, Laravel Forge, Laravel Envoyer, DigitalOcean,
                    AWS (including, but not limited to, some non-conventional services like the AWS Transcribe and AWS
                    IoT Core), Azure, GCP, among other things.</p>
                <p>And before that, I worked as a Back-end Engineer at Gabstr, a location-based social network. Built
                    the APIs we used there and a geolocation based content platform on top of Redis and PostGIS.</p>

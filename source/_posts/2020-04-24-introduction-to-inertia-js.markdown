excerpt: An Introduction to Inertia.JS.

Modern SPA frameworks can add drawbacks to a teamâ€™s workflows.

Inertia.JS allows building modern SPAs without most of those drawbacks, easily integrating with our backend framework of choice.

I wrote an introduction on Inertia.JS in the [madewithlove blog](https://madewithlove.com/introduction-to-inertia-js/)!

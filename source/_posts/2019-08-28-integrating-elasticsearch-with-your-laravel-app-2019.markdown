Searching is an important part of many applications, and it sometimes is treated as a simple task. "Just query using LIKE and you're good to go". While the _LIKE_ clause can be handy, sometimes we have to do some more complex queries.

After researching for a while I found a few good resources on the subject. The most attractive one is Elasticsearch. Yes, you can go far with full-text search and other searching techniques, however Elasticsearch is very handy and comes with a variety of useful features.

I wrote about using Elasticsearch and how to integrate it with your Laravel application in the [madewithlove's blog](https://madewithlove.com/how-to-integrate-elasticsearch-in-your-laravel-app-2019-edition/). Check it out if you like it.

Cheers,

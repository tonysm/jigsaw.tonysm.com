I shared a [tweet](https://twitter.com/tonysmdev/status/967481096995856385) a while back about building a Slack clone app in PHP using Laravel, VueJS, TailwindCSS, and Pusher. That got some attention, so I was invited by [Pusher](https://pusher.com/) to blog about using Pusher on it.

If you are into Laravel and/or WebSockets, check it out at [Pusher blog](https://blog.pusher.com/slack-clone-laravel-tailwindcss-vuejs/).
